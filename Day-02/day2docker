Docker Architecture – Key Building Blocks (Conceptual + Practical View)

As part of my DevOps upskilling, I revisited container architecture fundamentals with a focus on how Docker components interact at OS and runtime level.

🔹 1️⃣ Container Host / Docker Host
The Container Host is the underlying machine or OS where containers run.

• Can be physical, virtual, on-prem, or cloud-based
• Capacity planning depends on expected container density and workload type

Core components:
✔ Operating System (Linux / Windows)
✔ Container runtime (Docker Engine, containerd, CRI-O)

🔹 2️⃣ Container Client
The Docker Client acts as the interface between the user and Docker daemon.

• Executes CLI commands (docker run, docker build, etc.)
• Communicates with Docker daemon via REST APIs
• Can be local or remote (client–server architecture)

🔹 3️⃣ Container Images
Container images are immutable templates used to create containers.

• Contain application binaries, libraries, and configuration files
• Optimize deployment time by packaging dependencies once
• Can be community-maintained or custom-built for enterprise use

🔹 4️⃣ Container Registry Server
Registries store and distribute container images.

Community / Public registries:
• Docker Hub
• gcr.io
• registry.access.redhat.com
• quay.io

Private / Enterprise registries:
• Used for internal images, compliance, and security control

🔹 5️⃣ Containers
A container is a runtime instance of an image.

• Multiple containers can be launched from a single image
• Lightweight, isolated, and fast to start
• Ideal for microservices and scalable workloads

🔹 6️⃣ Linux Namespaces (Core Isolation Mechanism)
Namespaces provide isolation between containers at the kernel level.

• PID – Process isolation
• NET – Network stack isolation
• MNT – Filesystem isolation
• UTS – Hostname isolation
• IPC – Inter-process communication isolation

👉 This is what allows multiple containers to run securely on the same host.

📌 Understanding these building blocks is critical before moving into Docker networking, volumes, orchestration (Kubernetes), and production-grade deployments.

All notes and hands-on learning are being documented on GitHub as part of a structured DevOps journey.
